1. time_step_in_C_D_not_removed/: 
   - what's currently in the Spike model: Spike/Backend/CUDA/Plasticity/EvansSTDPPlasticity.cu
   - when solving the differential equation for C(t) and D(t), the second term involving Dirac delta function 
     is multipled by the timestep, which shouldn't be. 

   A. Data_0_to_50seconds/:
      - contains data with simulation time: 0-2, 0-4, 0-6, .....0-50 seconds. 
   B. Data_every_2_seconds/"
      - contains data with simulation time: 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, .....48-50 seconds. 

   The point is to see if the weight from these two scenarios are different. 

2. time_step_in_C_D_removed/:
    same as 1. except removing the timestep factor on Dirac delta function. 


3. production.C
   access raw SPIKE output and produce next level output. 
   execute "make" first to compile it. 


4. analyze_weight_change_after_STDP.C
   plot the difference in weight betwene different scenarios mentioned above. 

5. plot_raw_Spike_output.C
   place raw SPIKE output into ntuples for visualization

6. plot_Fig_9.C
   plot the Fig.9 

7. ana_Fig_9.C:
   analyze raw SPIKE to produce output needed to produce Fig.9
